    "# **About Bridge Grades Project: Bridge Grades Data Pipeline Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Philosophy\n",
    "\n",
    "Bridge Grades is built on four core principles that guide every aspect of our methodology:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Non-ideological:** Focus on behavior, not beliefs\n",
    "- **Data-driven:** Based on observable legislative actions  \n",
    "- **Transparent:** Derived from public, verifiable sources\n",
    "- **Comprehensive:** Capture multiple dimensions of collaboration\n",
    "\n",
    "These principles ensure that Bridge Grades measures **how** politicians behave rather than **what** they believe, providing objective assessments of bipartisan collaboration that transcend partisan divides.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Pipeline Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bridge Grades methodology follows a systematic data pipeline that transforms raw congressional data into meaningful collaboration grades. The pipeline consists of three main stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 1: Data Preprocessing Notebooks\n",
    "**Purpose:** Transform raw data sources into standardized, analysis-ready datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Each preprocessing notebook takes one or more raw data sources and converts them into the specific metrics needed for Bridge Grade calculations. These notebooks handle data cleaning, standardization, and initial metric calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 2: Data Integration and Scoring\n",
    "**Purpose:** Combine all processed datasets and calculate final Bridge Grades\n",
    "\n",
    "The main scoring engine takes all preprocessed datasets and applies the Bridge Grades algorithm to generate final letter grades (A, B, C, F) for each member of Congress.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 3: Output and Analysis\n",
    "**Purpose:** Generate final results and provide transparency into the scoring process\n",
    "\n",
    "Final datasets include complete scoring breakdowns, allowing users to understand exactly how each Bridge Grade was calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook Structure and Data Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preprocessing Notebooks (Data Sources A-N)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Source A-B: Legislator and Sponsorship Data Processing**\n",
    "- **Input:** Raw bill sponsorship data from Plural Policy\n",
