    "    'F': 1.0   # Personal attack percentage (maintained)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario 2: Balancing Communication and Action**\n",
    "```python\n",

    "    'B': 2.0,  # Cross-party cosponsorship\n",
    "    'C': 2.0,  # Bipartisan communication sum (increased)\n",
    "    'D': 2.0,  # Bipartisan communication percentage (increased)\n",
    "    'E': 1.5,  # Personal attack sum (increased penalty)\n",
    "    'F': 1.5   # Personal attack percentage (increased penalty)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario 3: Communication-Focused Analysis**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example weight configuration emphasizing public communication patterns\n",
    "weights = {\n",
    "    'A': 1.0,  # Bill authorship with cross-party support (decreased)\n",
    "    'B': 1.0,  # Cross-party cosponsorship (decreased)\n",
    "    'C': 3.0,  # Bipartisan communication sum (increased)\n",
    "    'D': 3.0,  # Bipartisan communication percentage (increased)\n",
    "    'E': 2.0,  # Personal attack sum (increased penalty)\n",
    "    'F': 2.0   # Personal attack percentage (increased penalty)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Expected Impact**\n",
    "\n",
    "This interactive dashboard will enable users to:\n",
    "- **Test Hypotheses:** Explore how different weight configurations affect specific legislators or groups\n",
    "- **Validate Methodology:** Ensure the scoring system remains robust across different weight scenarios\n",
    "- **Customize Analysis:** Adapt the Bridge Grades framework for specific research questions or policy objectives\n",
    "- **Enhance Transparency:** Provide complete visibility into how different factors contribute to final scores\n"
